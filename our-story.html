                <p class="story"> &nbsp; &nbsp;  My heart and soul has gone into the making of this space and I seek to always maintain that integrity with every step I make. <br> I want to tell you a little about me and my path to opening my own salon and where I am wanting to take it. Hang in there, it's kinda long.

                  Never in my wildest dreams did I think  I would have become a hairdresser. Sure, in high school I would force my younger sisters to sit so i can make their   hair <br> all kinds of ways and crazy styles, but it just never crossed my mind.<br>  I remember a friend saying I would have my own salon one day and I told her she was crazy! Hair? Me? <br>  I thought maybe makeup, but other peoples hair, no way! Lol! Growing up I thought I wanted to be a teacher, but come time graduation I knew traditional school was not for me. So did my mom. So, she asked me a question that changed my life forever, and I use it now when I have clients who seem to need help with their life direction.  She said, “What would you do for rest of your life for free?” “What?” I asked.  She said, “Yeah, think of something you like to do and lets figure out how you can make money doing it.”</p>
                  This began the adventure to start all over again! I knew that I didn’t want to work for anyone else, so I prepared myself to open my own salon.  I attended a salon owners seminar and decided I was ready. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would ever want to be involved with managing a business, but somehow , it being my direct business it's kinda fun! I found my cute little space near the sweet and quaint ...........  Here I hope to grow Salon Seed to be the kind of place that I so longed for when I first started. A place where technique is refined, creativity is nurtured, and good vibes are a must! Every product has been hand selected by me, after doing research on the businesses and their values. I proudly carry most of the Davines range of styling products and slowly building to have every single offering.
